First, game designers can use rewards to motivate players to take specific actions. For example, a game might reward players with points for completing challenges, or with new weapons or abilities for defeating enemies. These rewards can help to keep players engaged and motivated to continue playing.\\n\\nSecond, rewards can be used to create a sense of progression in a game. As players earn rewards, they can feel a sense of accomplishment and progress, which can help to keep them engaged. This is especially important in games with a long-term goal, such as leveling up or completing a story.\\n\\nThird, rewards can be used to create a sense of competition between players. For example, a game might track players' scores or rankings, or it might allow players to compete against each other in multiplayer modes. This can help to keep players engaged and motivated to improve their skills.\\n\\nFinally, rewards can be used to create a sense of community in a game. For example, a game might allow players to trade items or compete in cooperative challenges. This can help to create a sense of camaraderie and belonging, which can help to keep players engaged and motivated to keep playing.\\n\\nThe key factors that influence player engagement and retention are:\\n\\n* **Challenge:** Players need to feel challenged in order to stay engaged.

Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate NAME_1 sequence of hidden states NAME_2 t , as NAME_1 function of the previous hidden state NAME_2 t\u22121 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 16] . The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach NAME_1 new state of the art in translation quality after being trai": 0,

This hypothesis has been tested in a number of ways, including studies of color perception.\\n\\nOne study that supports the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was conducted by NAME_1 NAME_2 (1969). They found that languages differ in the number of basic color terms they have. For example, English has 11 basic color terms, while Russian has 12. This difference in the number of color terms is reflected in the way speakers of these languages perceive color. Speakers of English are more likely to see subtle differences between colors that are close together in the color spectrum, while speakers of Russian are more likely to see subtle differences between colors that are further apart in the color spectrum.\\n\\nAnother study that supports the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was conducted by NAME_3 (1992). She found that speakers of different languages who have different color terms for the same color may also have different concepts of that color. For example, speakers of the NAME_4 language in New Guinea have only two basic color terms, \\\"mili\\\" (which refers to dark colors) and \\\"molu\\\" (which refers to light colors). As a result, speakers of NAME_4 have difficulty distinguishing between colors that are close together in the color spectrum, such as red and orange.\\n\\nThese studies suggest that the structure of our language can influence the way we perceive the world.

Here's the input text:\n\nInput Text: The SM Policy states under section 11.4, that prepayment should be avoided and all purchases, other than petty cash purchases, should be made on credit. Contrary to this, the audit observed that the institute had on several occasions agreed, by signing agreements in which part of the payment terms were payment of a certain percentage of the contract value was payable in advance. For example, in most agreements with contractors engaged for various engineering works projects during the period under review, payment terms included a requirement for the institute to pay 50% of the contract amount in advance. One specific example of such a contractor is KS Ltd., who, in various agreements signed with them in the period under review (e.g., for the Engineering Building Civil and Builders works and Refurbishment Of The Directorate Office projects, whose contract sums were KES 33,825,876.52 and KES 10,233,045, respectively), the institute had agreed and went ahead to pay 50% of the contract sums in advance. \n\nFurther under section 13.1.3., the SMP states, Consulting fees should be paid on the basis of deliverables and that advances are not advisable. However, the audit observed cases in which the institute had agreed to paying some consultants in advance. An example is CC Ltd., the consulting firm hired to prepare a business plan and assist with the preparation of the Management Plan for K, who was on 19th October 2022 paid 20% of the USD 33,000 contract amount in advance. \n\nOf even greater concern was that these advance payments were not supported by a justification from the requesting units or a security from the respective suppliers/consultants.\n\nYour task would be to generate a rewritten version of this internal audit finding that retains its audit observation tone and approach while avoiding overused phrases or repetition.

In some cases, it can even lead to violence or other forms of unrest.\\n\\nThe potential consequences of deviating from established protocols or procedures can vary depending on the sport and the severity of the infraction. In some cases, officials may be subject to disciplinary action, such as suspension or even termination. In other cases, they may be required to pay fines or restitution. In the most serious cases, officials may even face criminal charges.\\n\\nIt is important for officials to understand the importance of following established protocols and procedures. By doing so, they can help to ensure the fairness and integrity of competition, and they can protect themselves from potential consequences.\\n\\nHere are some specific examples of how rules and regulations can impact the fairness and integrity of competition:\\n\\n* In football, the rule that prohibits players from roughing the passer helps to prot": 1,

  "article:\nMindfulness meditation has been found to calm the stress response, commonly known as \u201cfight-or-flight.\u201d\n\nThe stress response occurs when the part of your brain called the amygdala perceives a threat. In response, a flood of hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol, are released, causing a range of physiological changes, such as increased respiration and blood flow to your extremities and to your brain, preparing your muscles to go into action and heightening your senses, among other potential life-preserving measures.\n\nWhen the threat subsides, the parasympathetic nervous system kicks in to slow these reactions and bring your body back to a baseline state.\n\nBut the stress response isn\u2019t just a reaction to an obvious threat. It can be triggered by anything your brain perceives as a threat\u2014like the psychological stress of feeling overwhelmed, or physical discomfort, such as chronic pain. Regardless of the cause, the brain and the body react in the same way, to prepare you to fight, freeze, or flee.\n\nInstruction: Generate 3 completely different mindfulness questions and answers from above web article excerpt in first person perspective in different scenarios for users who might benefit from mindfulness": 0,

Materials cost - This includes the cost of steel, aluminum, plastic, rubber, electronics, and other components that make up the vehicle. Higher materials costs increase the manufacturing cost and final price.\\n\\n2. Labor cost - The wages paid to factory workers and engineers account for a significant portion of the manufacturing cost. Higher labor costs increase the price. \\n\\n3. Production efficiency - How quickly and smoothly a vehicle can be assembled in the factory impacts cost. More efficient production processes with fewer mistakes and rework generally lower costs.\\n\\n4. Technology - The increasing use of advanced technology in vehicles like infotainment systems, driver assistance features, and hybrid/electric powertrains increases material and R&D costs, which are passed on to consumers.\\n\\n5. Research and development - The costs associated with designing and engineering a new or redesigned vehicle model must be factored into the price. Higher R&D expenditures increase costs.\\n\\n6. Supply chain management - How well a automaker manages its supplier network and secures favorable component pricing from suppliers impacts manufacturing cost. Better supply chain management can help lower costs.\\n\\n7. Overhead costs - Expenses like factory rent/mortgage, insurance, utilities, and administrative costs are distributed across the number of vehicles produced, raising the final price.\\n\\nThose are the major factors that car companies consider an": 1,

It can also help to stabilize and increase the effectiveness of vitamin E, another essential nutrient for skin health.\n\nRetinol, on the other hand, is a derivative of vitamin A that has been shown to have a direct impact on reducing acne symptoms. As mentioned earlier, it can help unclog pores and reduce sebum production.\n\nUltimately, the most effective approach may be to incorporate both vitamin C and retinol into a comprehensive skincare routine, tailored to individual needs.

Polish the writing to meet the academic style, improve the spelling, grammar, clarity, concision and overall readability. When necessary, rewrite the whole sentence. Furthermore, list all modification and explain the reasons to do so in markdown table. Paragraph:The simulation results are presented in NAME_1. \\ref{NAME_1_7}.\nNAME_1.\\ref{NAME_1_7}a and \\ref{NAME_1_7}b show that the robot joints can track the reference signals well, even with discontinuities. The system remains stable even when the tracking errors exceed the pre-defined funnel boundary. Moreover, the system limits the overshoot of the tracking error when the reference signals have large jumps, indicating its ability to cope with sudden changes in operating conditions. Despite the coupling effects in the robot system, the reference signal of joint 2 stays invariant at time \n\ufffd\n1\nt \n1\n\u200b\n , when joint 1 first jumps randomly. The tracking error of joint 2 also stays within the funnel boundary, ensuring satisfactory tracking accuracy. Similarly, when joint 2 has an independent jump at time \n\ufffd\n2\nt \n2\n\u200b\n , joint 1 can still follow the reference signal \n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n1\nq \nd1\n\u200b\n  accurately. At time \n\ufffd\n3\nt \n3\n\u200b\n , both joints have simultaneous but different jumps, and the proposed method can still guarantee good tracking performance for both joints.\nNAME_1.\\ref{NAME_1_7}c shows the control inputs, which are large when both joints have concurrent jumps, to ensure the convergence of the tracking error to the steady-state funnel boundary within a predetermined time.": 0,

I have taken all necessary precautions and followed recommended care instructions to ensure the bike's longevity, so such a catastrophic failure is both unexpected and unacceptable.\n\nI understand that no product is flawless, but the failure of a Trek bike, to this degree, is very alarming. I am hoping that this incident is an isolated case and not reflective of a broader issue with your product line.\n\nAs the situation stands, I kindly request your immediate assistance in rectifying this issue. I would appreciate it if you could provide either a replacement bike of the same model or a full refund of the purchase price. I believe this is the least that can be done considering the severity of the issue at hand.\n\nI look forward to your prompt response and appropriate action to restore my confidence in your brand.": 0,

This technique is non-destructive and can be used to study the surface properties of a wide range of materials, including metals, semiconductors, and biological samples.\n\nOne of the main applications of SPM is in the field of nanotechnology, where it is used to study and manipulate materials at the nanoscale. This includes the ability to fabricate and manipulate nanostructures, such as nanoparticles and nanotubes, as well as to study their properties and interactions with other materials.\n\nSPM is also widely used in the field of materials science, where it is used to study the properties and behavior of materials at the atomic and molecular level. This includes the ability to measure the mechanical properties of materials, such as stiffness and adhesion, as well as to study the electronic properties of materials, such as conductivity and electron density.": 0,

NAME_10 and NAME_11, \u201cHVDC PLUS and SVC PLUS: Reliable and Cost-effective Power Transmission Solutions with Modular Multilevel Converters,\u201d 2011, \nThe problem with the above prior art is that the cell design is highly optimized for a particular topology and current rating. The optimization for a particular current rating affects, for example, the choice of IGBT/diode module, cell capacitor and bypass switch. The current rating is often given as share of a predetermined current value. For example, a fully-rated cell can carry the whole predetermined current. A half-rated cell can only carry half of the predetermined current. While a half-rated cell may theoretically result in half the size, the constituent component availability may preclude this, e.g. if the IGBT module is only available to suit the full cell rating. Even where half-rated cell components are available, each half-rated cell will still require the same quantity of control components, i.e. cell controller, current/voltage sensors, cell power supply, etc., as the fully-rated cell and a similar cost and volume of mechanical components. The rack-support structure for multiple cells will also be different, because of the different size. Therefore a half-rated cell will result in significantly more than half the cost and volume of the fully-rated cell, and hence the resulting MMC converter will be more expensive (\u20ac/kW) and less power dense (kW/m3). Furthermore, the half-rated cell will require a separate design, with associated engineering costs.": 1,

  "As a skilled TOEFL teacher, please review the NAME_1, ensuring that your answer follows the instructions:\nQuestion:\n\nDo you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who develop many different skills are more successful than people who focus on one skill only. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nNAME_1:\n\nIt's critically significant for everyone to develop some skills in today's hectic society. While someone think people may success more easily when they focus on one particular skill, I agree the statement that people are easier to success when they develop many different skills instead. Two main reasons will be explored in the following essays.\n\nFirst and foremost, when people develop various skills, it means that they can get more chances by their skills easier than other people. My personal experience can be a compelling example. Around five years ago, I graduated from my junior high school. And during that summer holiday, I decided to learn English and singing together. When I got into my senior high school, I was told that there was a chance to perform in front of every new student in the opening ceremony, but the requirement is that this person much be good at both English and singing. As a result of my hard working during my summer holiday, I got the chance and left everyone a great impression. If I didn't learn these two skills at that summer, I won't get the chance. And after this performance, whenever there needed someone to perform, teachers would come to me at first.\n\nSecondly, people developed more skills can easily made more friends as they share same interests. These friends will become our people net, whenever people encounter some difficulties, they can turn to friend for help. Take my friend as an example, she is an extroverted person and interested in all kinds of things. She acknowledged photographing, jazzing, making perfumes, video editing and so on. Naturally, she knows a lot of friends from our university or other universities. And when she was looking for a internship, she just needs to ask her friends whether these are someone who know their company is looking for an intern. Of course, some friends of her does know and recommend her to their company. It saves a lot of time and have a recommendation is really helpful for an intern.\n\nIn conclusion, various skills could help people success easier as they can help people earn more chances to show themselves and make more friends who can help you in some days from my perspectives.\n\n- Display title: 1.\u5b50\u9879\u5f97\u5206.

During the Empire\u2019s reign, women weren\u2019t allowed to vote, own land, or get certain jobs. But now, women can do all these things and more! We can choose from a wide variety of careers and be treated equally (almost). It is so impressive that women have come so far since the Roman Empire and now have so many rights and authority. I wonder if women will end up being treated equally one day too.\n\n\nEvidence: In 216 BC, the Roman Senate passed a law that said women could only be paid between $3 and $3.50 per week. (in comparison, men were getting paid over 6 dollars per week) This shows that women were not treated the same as men when it came to money and jobs. Roman girls usually married around the age of fourteen or fifteen, and once a woman was married, she had even fewer rights. (This changed in 27BC) While her husband was gone, women could earn a few more coins from a limited number of jobs. Some of the jobs the women had was merchants, wet nurses, midwives, scribes, and dancers. In the 1800\u2019s women were being hired to work in factories for an incredibly low price, but by the 1840s, seventy-five percent of the jobs at Lowell mills were taken by women. During this period, women's roles changed dramatically. This revolution changed the role of women at home, at the same time opening new opportunities for them as wage owners.

It is a rare early childhood intractable epileptic encephalopathy, which is associated with cognitive decline, pleomorphic seizure activity, and motor and behavioural abnormalities.\n\nDS has been primarily associated with mutations in the gene SCN1A (Nav1.1 protein). It has been postulated that dysfunction of inhibitory neurons is associated with the development of DS. Nav1.1 protein product is the primary voltage-gated sodium channel in inhibitory neurons, and the impairment of Nav1.1 leads to unregulated transmission from gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons.[1] \nGenetic studies have identified that duplications/deletions, missense mutations, nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, or splice site mutations are responsible for the development of DS. Milder manifestations of DS might be observed due to missense mutations in SCN1A.\nOther genes that have also been correlated to DS are SCN2A, SCN1B, SCN8A, PCDH19, STXBP1, GABRA1 and GABRG2.\nDS evolves with age; following onset of seizure during infancy, neurodevelopmental delays progress to severe neurologic disability.": 0,

The action being described is called the Stem Action. For example: For the Stem Action of 'drinking alcohol', 'getting drunk' is a Higher-Level Action Identity because it describes why the action is done, and 'sipping and swallowing'  is a Lower-Level Action Identity because it describes how the action is done. Any action can be described by many Lower-Level Action Identities or Higher-Level Action Identities. For example, one person might describe the Stem Action of \"doing a writing assignment' as 'sharing my knowledge', which is a Higher-Level Action Identity, while another person might describe the same behavior as 'pressing keys on the keyboard', whichis a Lower-Level Action Identity.\"\n\nBased on what I have just explained, generate a list of 10 behaviors, and describe each of them using 1 higher-level and 1 lower-level action identity.": 0,

To my left and right, at least a dozen other women stood in similar situations, their faces stoic or cast down in defeat.\nSuddenly, the sound of wheels on the road caught my attention. A wagon approached, and with it came two guards clad in steel armor and helmets that obscured their faces. They began to escort the women one by one, and soon it was my turn. The guard gestured for me to follow him, and I complied without a word.\nWe climbed into the covered wagon, and he assisted me up into it. The cover provided a cool relief from the heat outside, and after what felt like an eternity, we were joined by all of the women who had been selected. The guards lifted the wagon door into place and gave an unseen hand gesture to the driver in front, and we began our journey.\nAs we rode through the sun-soaked countryside, I couldn't help but feel a mix of fear and anticipation. Uncertainty about what lay ahead filled my mind, but at the same time, I felt a thrill of excitement at the thought of what was to come.\nAs we stepped inside the building, my heart began to race. I could feel the weight of the situation pressing down on me like an anchor, and a sense of dread filled my chest. The air was thick with anticipation, but it was also tinged with fear - fear for what lay ahead, and fear for what might happen if we failed.\nWe were led through the large brick building by two guards, our eyes fixed on the ground as we walked. The walls inside seemed to close in around us, the concrete cold under our feet. We passed through a series of dimly lit corridors, each one more foreboding than the last.\nFinally, we arrived at the center of the room where three individuals sat on a large coach - a gray-haired man with a gruff voice, a caramel-brown woman with wild curly hair, and a fair-skinned woman with piercing green eyes. The man introduced himself as Doctor NAME_1 in his rough tone, and I could feel the weight of his authority pressing down on me like a heavy burden.\n\n\"Greetings,\u201d he said as the final woman entered the room and we took our seats, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.

The following paragraph provides some information on the causes and impacts of climate change:\n\nParagraph:\nClimate change is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

The far right will have  to build on their four hundred-strong crowd which fought police outside a hotel with asylum-seekers in Knowsley, near Liverpool, on 10 February. Only around fifty fascists came, Patriotic Alternative, Yorkshire Rose, and British Bulldog being the known groups among them. They were held by the police on a roundabout on the main road, while the counter-demo was outside the front of the hotel, kettled between a fence and a police line. Trade unionists, the left, and students, along with migrant action groups, turned out in significant numbers, with three coaches and a convoy of cars. Sheffield Trades Union Council organised and funded coaches from Sheffield. Without that, numbers would have been much smaller. The police issued a Section 14 notice for the day with fixed positions for the demo, and threats of arrest if it was ignored. They insisted on a demo in a car park rather than a confrontation to run the far right out of town. Moves were made to break through the police line to confront the fascists. Each attempt was shut down by the police, aided by the SWP calling on people to remain where they were and not \"cause trouble\". A small group did break through to confront the group of fascists on the roundabout, then were surrounded and brought back to the designated zone. Placards displayed in the windows of the hotel communicated with the demo with messages saying \"Thank you\" and \"We are not illegal\". The demo was low on politics. Placards from Sheffield Solidarity Group stood out with the slogan \"Jobs and Homes not Racism\". Speakers were controlled by the SWP, though one from Orgreave Truth and Justice and the chair of Sheffield TUC got in. It was an impressive and important mobilisation, but only the beginning.

This includes how we conceptualize and categorize things. With regards to color, research has found that speakers of different languages often categorize colors differently and have different color naming systems.\\n\\nFor example, English distinguishes \\\"blue\\\" and \\\"green\\\" as separate colors with distinct names. However, some languages, like Russian and Japanese, do not distinguish between light blue and green, labeling them with the same color term. Studies have found that speakers of these languages have more difficulty distinguishing blue and green colors compared to English speakers.\\n\\nThe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis explains this by arguing that the language we speak influences how we perceive color. If a language does not have distinct terms for blue and green, then speakers of that language may not mentally categorize blue and green as separate colors. Their color perception is shaped by the structure of their language.\\n\\nIn summary, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis accounts for differences in color perception across languages by proposing that the color naming systems and categorizations present in a language impact how speakers of that language mentally organize and experience color. The structure of the language shapes the structure of thought, to at least some degree, according to this hypothesis.": 1,

This advantage can be seen in a variety of sports, including baseball, basketball, football, and soccer.\\n\\nThere are a number of factors that contribute to home-field advantage. One factor is the familiarity of the home team with the playing field. The home team is typically more familiar with the dimensions of the field, the lighting conditions, and the weather conditions. This familiarity can give the home team a competitive edge.\\n\\nAnother factor that contributes to home-field advantage is the support of the home crowd. The home crowd can provide a significant boost of energy and motivation for the home team. The crowd can also create a hostile environment for the visiting team, which can make it difficult for the visiting team to focus and play their best.\\n\\nFinally, the home team may have a slight advantage in terms of travel. The home team does not have to travel as far to get to the game, which can help them to stay fresh and avoid fatigue.\\n\\nThe strength of home-field advantage can vary depending on the sport. In some sports, such as baseball and basketball, the home team has a significant advantage. In other sports, such as football and soccer, the home team's advantage is smaller.\\n\\nThe home-field advantage can be a significant factor in determining the outcome of a game or series. In some cases, the home-field advantage can be the deciding factor in a close game or series.\\n\\nHere are some of the key factors that con": 1,

Music technology has made it possible for anyone with a computer to create music, regardless of their musical background or skills. This has led to a democratization of music creation, as anyone can now produce high-quality music without the need for expensive equipment or training.\\n* **New possibilities**. Music technology has opened up new possibilities for composers, allowing them to create sounds that were previously impossible to achieve. For example, synthesizers can be used to create a wide range of electronic sounds, while digital audio workstations can be used to manipulate and edit audio in ways that were previously impossible.\\n* **Collaboration**. Music technology has made it easier for composers to collaborate with others, both locally and internationally.

  "Completely rewrite this chapter of a book for woodworking lovers, with a professional tone, use simple words to make the text understandable to all:  The Formation of Trees\n\nWhen discussing tree varieties, we often refer to two types: those with cones and those that shed their leaves. Regardless of the tree type, all trees consist of three essential components: the top, the middle, and the bottom (refer to Figure 1.1). Let's delve into each of these components.\n\nThe top part of a tree is known as the crown, where branches and leaves are found. In certain trees, such as pines, the leaves resemble needles. The crown performs an incredible function by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air and water from the ground via the roots and trunk. When sunlight is present, a remarkable process called photosynthesis takes place in the green leaves. This process converts carbon and water into vital substances that facilitate the tree's growth and survival.\n\nThe middle part of the tree is referred to as the trunk, akin to the tree's backbone. The trunk supports the crown and connects it to the bottom part. Importantly, the trunk plays a significant role in transporting minerals from the ground to the crown and conveying organic substances created in the leaves. Additionally, the trunk stores the necessary nutrients for the tree. Remarkably, the trunk can occupy nearly half of the tree's overall size, and in certain cases, even up to 90%!\n\nThe bottom part of the tree comprises the roots. The roots exist in two forms: small roots that absorb water infused with dissolved minerals, and thick roots that stabilize the trunk and transport water to the crown. Furthermore, the roots store additional nutrients for the tree. Collaboratively, the roots, crown, and trunk work together to ensure the tree's survival and continual growth.\n\nTo comprehend the structure of wood, it is vital to grasp the formation of a tree. By familiarizing ourselves with these distinct parts and their interconnected functions, we can begin to truly appreciate the remarkable substance we know as wood.": 0,

We purchased the frosted 42\u00d772 and absolutely love it so far. It doesn't shift easily on the table. Its in a somewhat sunny window and isn't blinding. I can still see the pretty wood underneath that we loved. Everyday it gets flatter and its been a great solution so far! I do wish it was a hair wider, as our table is 44 inches wide, but I just slide it over to the side my kids eat and its fine. We are also happy they can do do homework and we can write on it easily now without the rustic texture of the table making that difficult. Its been a game changer for us so far!\n\nReview2: good product but was smaller than told\nI like this product but it was 1 inch smaller than it was supposed to be so it did not quite cover my entire table.\n\nReview 3: Very good protector, easily stains\nI bought this protector to prevent food from getting into the grooves of our table and also to protect my placemats from getting dirty, it does the job for the purpose that I bought it for, but my only problem is that it stains very easily!!! And I mean like right away! So if anything spills on it like salsa, tomato sauce, etc\u2026.. it will stain!!!!!! Which it\u2019s a biggie if you like to keep your table clean!! The stains on the protector make the table look dirty!!! And table decor wise\u2026 the stains ruin the decoration underneath it!!! If you purchase it, wipe it CLEAN RIGHT AWAY !!! I\u2019m only showing some of the stains on mine but it has many more ! And no we don\u2019t leave the table dirty !! We clean it right after we\u2019re done eating ! But like i said it stains right away!\n\nReview 4: Accomplishes the goal\nThis is a great concept and I'm not unhappy with it. It does accomplish my goal of smoothing a desktop with a seam in it - two boards that create the desktop, the seam where they come together in the middle. However, the texture of the smooth side is tacky/sticky so that the mouse doesn't move smoothly and items stick rather than slide. If you use a mousepad, that won't be an issue. It's really just a matter of lifting items rather than sliding them.": 0,

  "Rewrite this text in a shorter way and keep the important bits:\n\nAnalysing the notable contrasts observed, we identified instances where low Specificity coincided with high Transparency or vice versa. Such discrepancies hold important implications for the reliability and comprehensiveness of the information disseminated on Twitter about OI. High Transparency without corresponding Specificity raises concerns regarding the accuracy and depth of information conveyed. Conversely, situations where high Specificity is coupled with low Transparency may suggest potential challenges in comprehending or validating the information shared. Possible reasons behind these discrepancies may include variations in the reporting styles of Twitter users and the influence of communication constraints imposed by the Twitter platform itself. Overall, we observed differences in specificity and transparency scores for 21 tweets. A list of exemplary tweets with contrasting Transparency and Specificity is laid out in Table 5. The presence of contrasts between specificity and transparency calls for further investigation into the underlying factors contributing to these discrepancies and their impact on the reliability and usefulness of the information disseminated on Twitter about OI.\nOne possible interpretation of very high specificity and low transparency scores can be attributed to jargon and excessive use of hashtags and icons. As the tweet becomes more specific, the size constraints of a tweet become progressively more relevant, forcing the writer to resort to jargon that the target audience is expected to understand. This jargon usage, in turn, reduces the Transparency for an average reader. This insight suggests the possible presence of an inverted-U shape relationship between Specificity and Transparency, where an excessive Specificity results in a lower perceived level of Transparency.": 2,

Use academic jargon sparingly and only when appropriate. Keep the overall original meanings the text covers.  Rewrite the following: \"Body Mass Index (BMI) is one of the most commonly used measures in large-scale epidemiological studies to quantify body weight (WHO, 2016). BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Since it measures weight relative to height, many people mistakenly assume that it measures obesity. However, BMI does not distinguish lean mass from fat mass or provide insight into someone\u2019s body composition (WHO, 2016). Moreover, since it accounts for the square of the height rather than its linear relationship with body weight, it depends on body height. This means that people of the same weight can have different health risks depending on their height and vice versa (WHO, 2016). BMI ranges from normal body weight (18.5\u201325) to overweight (25\u201330), obese class I (30\u201335), obese class II (35\u201340), and severely obese (40), with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with each category (WHO, 2016). However, new research suggests that the range of \u201cnormal\u201d BMI is narrower than initially thought, with a higher risk of chronic disease and mortality at both ends of the spectrum (NAME_1 NAME_2 NAME_3., 2002; Romero-NAME_4 NAME_2 NAME_3., 2005; Kuk NAME_2 NAME_3., 2016)": 2,

Reducing vehicle weight can improve performance, handling, acceleration and fuel economy. For example, carbon fiber can be up to 50% lighter than steel while providing similar strength. Aluminum is around one third the weight of steel.\\n\\nPerformance: Lighter weight components allow for quicker acceleration, better handling and improved braking performance. The stiffness and strength-to-weight ratio of materials like carbon fiber can improve vehicle dynamics.\\n\\nFuel efficiency: Every 100 lbs of weight reduction can improve fuel economy by 1-2%. So moving to lighter materials like aluminum and carbon fiber can lead to noticeable gains in MPG.\\n\\nHowever, there are also challenges with using these advanced materials:\\n\\nCost: Carbon fiber and aluminum alloys tend to be significantly more expensive than traditional steel. This increased cost needs to be balanced with the performance gains.\\n\\nManufacturing: Carbon fiber and some aluminum alloys require different manufacturing techniques which can be more complex and expensive to implement for automakers.\\n\\nRecyclability: It can be harder to recycle materials like carbon fiber composites at end of life, posing sustainability challenges. Aluminum is more recyclable.\\n\\nSo in summary, while advanced materials provide clear benef": 1,

It is likely that the number of highly cited patent families will decrease as the average age of patent families increases. This is because older patents are less likely to have a significant impact in the field and will therefore be less likely to be highly cited. Conversely, highly cited patent families are more likely to be younger, as they have had more time to accumulate citations.\n\nThe estimated costs of a patent in 2023 are represented by the size of the dots on the plot. The larger the dot, the higher the estimated cost of the patent. This information is useful for patent holders and researchers, as it provides an understanding of the costs associated with maintaining and enforcing a patent.\n\nIn conclusion, the scatter plot in the patent report provides valuable information about the relationship between the average age of patent families and the number of highly cited patent families. It also provides information about the estimated costs of a patent in 2023, which can be used to inform decision-making related to patent management and enforcement.\n\nFor example, the cost of a patent in a country with high IP office fees will be higher than in a country with low IP office fees.

Supervised machine learning relies on labeled input and output training data, whereas unsupervised learning processes unlabelled or raw data.\\n\\nIn supervised learning, the model learns the relationship between the labeled input and output data. Models are finetuned until they can accurately predict the outcomes of unseen data. However, labeled training data will often be resource intensive to create.\\n\\nIn unsupervised learning, the model learns to identify patterns in the data without any guidance. This can be useful for tasks such as clustering data or identifying outliers. However, unsupervised learning models can be more difficult to interpret than supervised learning models.\\n\\nThe accuracy and efficiency of machine learning algorithms in different applications can be impacted by the type of learning used. Supervised learning algorithms tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning algorithms, but they require more labeled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be more efficient, but they can be less accurate.\\n\\nThe best type of learning to use for a particular application will depend on the specific requirements of the task. For tasks where accuracy is critical, supervised learning is often the best choice. For tasks where efficiency is critical, unsupervised learning may be a better option.\\n\\nHere are some examples of how supervised and unsupervised learning are used in different applications:\\n\\n* *": 1,

  "You are given this comprehensive guide on creating great bedtime stories for kids aged 3-8 years old:\n----\n1. Appeal to Parents:\nImpress parents with depth, subtle complexities, broader life lessons, and relevant themes. Avoid any scenes or subjects that parents would not approve of, like a kid \"flying\" out of the window, or leaving home at night, or eating something they shouldn't, etc. Be careful on that.\n\n2. Develop Relatable Characters:\nCreate characters that embody emotions and experiences kids can identify with. Their growth is as vital as the plot.\n\n3. The Three 'E's - Engage, Educate, and Entertain:\nStrive to captivate, impart knowledge subtly, and keep the narrative fun. Use humor and adventurous elements for entertainment.\n\n4. Apply the Rule of Three:\nUse the technique of presenting in threes for satisfaction and memorability - characters, events, or wishes.\n\n5. Craft a Vivid Setting:\nDetailed depiction of settings helps immerse the readers in your story world, be it a fantasy land or a bustling city.\n\n6. Introduce Conflict and Resolution:\nInclude an age-appropriate conflict and resolution in your story, which should deliver a positive lesson or outcome.\n\n7. Incorporate Sensory Descriptions:\nMake your story immersive by engaging multiple senses - sights, sounds, smells, touch, and taste.\n\n8. Add Interactive Elements:\nConsider embedding elements like questions or activities related to the story to engage children actively.\n----\nUse this guide to create an amazing bedtime story for kids.\nUse the style of NAME_1 to create the plot. We basically want a \"Rick and Morty\" plot, appropriate for kids aged 3-8 years old.\nDo not do the usual boring \"embark on an adventure\" plot. Do something new, innovative and creative. Make some twisted version of a daily thing, with some interesting additions and extravagant poetic license. It's for kids but we want to be smart about it and be unique and stand out of all the other stories for kids. Like NAME_1's plots.\n\nWrite the linear outlining of the whole story.\nWrite the main characters profiles ( diverse, charming and relatable ), then the premise, plot ( beginning/middle/end ) and scene breakdown (write a brief description for each scene, noting the key events and character developments).\n\nProceed without any further clarifications. Write just the linear outlining based on everything I wrote.\n\nAt the end, give 5 suggestions for the title of the story. It has to be attractive and create a sense of wanting to hear the story.": 1,

For example, olive oil is a good source of monounsaturated fats, which are considered to be heart-healthy. Canola oil is a good source of polyunsaturated fats, which are also considered to be heart-healthy. Coconut oil is a good source of saturated fat, which is not considered to be as healthy as unsaturated fats.\\n* **Flavor:** The flavor of a food can also be affected by the type of oil used to cook it. For example, olive oil has a strong, nutty flavor that can add depth and complexity to dishes. Canola oil has a more neutral flavor, which makes it a good choice for dishes where you want the flavor of the food to shine through. Coconut oil has a sweet, tropical flavor that can be used to add richness and depth to desserts and curries.\\n* **Texture:** The texture of a food can also be affected by the type of oil used to cook it. For example, olive oil has a high smoke point, which means that it can be used for high-heat cooking without breaking down and creating harmful compounds. Canola oil also has a high smoke point, but it is not as flavorful as olive oil. Coconut oil has a low smoke point, which means that it should not be used for high-heat cooking.\\n\\nThe key factors that determine the choice of oil for a particular dish include the following:\\n\\n* **The type of food:** Some foods,": 1,

This technique can be used to measure the absorption or emission of light by a material, and is often used in the field of solid-state electronics and photovoltaics. One application of photocurrent spectroscopy is in the characterization of solar cells, where it can be used to determine the efficiency of the cell and identify any defects or impurities in the material. Another application is in the study of semiconductor devices, where photocurrent spectroscopy can be used to measure the electrical properties of the material and identify any changes that occur as a result of exposure to light. \nuser: How does it differ from other spectroscopic techniques?. \nasistent: Photocurrent spectroscopy differs from other spectroscopic techniques in that it specifically measures the photocurrent generated by a material rather than the absorpt": 0,

Quantum computers are able to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers because they can exploit the properties of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement.\\n\\nFor example, quantum computers can be used to factor large numbers, which is a key step in breaking many cryptographic algorithms. Quantum computers can also be used to simulate complex chemical reactions, which could lead to new drugs and materials. And quantum computers can be used to train machine learning models that are much more accurate than those that can be trained on classical computers.\\n\\nHere are some specific examples of how quantum computing can be used to solve complex computational problems in other fields:\\n\\n* **Machine learning:** Quantum computers can be used to train machine learning models that are much more accurate than those that can be trained on classical computers. This is because quantum computers can exploit the properties of superposition and entanglement to learn from much larger datasets than classical computers can.\\n* **Cryptography:** Quantum computers can be used to break many cryptographic algorithms that are currently considered secure. This is because quantum computers can factor large numbers much faster than classical computers. This could have a significant impact on the security of the i": 1,

  "Think this through step by step: Scene Writing Method = In fiction, use empathy, imagery, and evocative storytelling to suspend disbelief, create expectations, and ground the reader in the narrative world. Suspend disbelief through sensory details, dramatic juxtapositions, and world-building narration spoken by a POV character. Effective surprise is done through managing readers' expectations by manipulating their inductive reasoning. First set up thematic and/or dramatic patterns within the narrative context of the scene to create expectations, then payoff the patterns in surprising, but inevitable reveals that subvert & violate those expectations. Pace the story to maximize emotional catharsis for the reader  with a credibly suspenseful, climactic peak moment towards the scene's final moments. Act as {a best-selling author} of {African American political thriller} and write a scene that exemplifies the method described. Use any theme except the one about patterns/catharsis and do not write on-the-nose dialogue or exposition - instead, \"bury the lead\" and use subtle nuance to hint at essential dramatic details needed to understand the narrative.

Text: Distribution systems: Supplying products to consumers is expensive: insurance acquisition costs maybe 20% or more of premium. Efficient systems reduce costs and improve marketing control, but they require high upfront investment, such as subsidies to exclusive agents in their early years, discounts for insurance coverage sold through banks, discounts for insurance sold through voluntary associations, advertising campaigns to establish brand names, direct response insurance sales to avoid agency costs, and participation in internet web sites. Initial expenses lower current profits but may improve the insurer\u2019s future profits. Rating agencies stress control, cost, and consumer access. Does the insurer control its distribution system (exclusive agents, direct marketing) or does it work through independent agents and brokers? Are its costs lower or higher than those of its peers? W hat are the conversion ratios (new policy sales over quotations) and renewal ratios by line? Does the distribution system reach the target market? Control: Exclusive agents give insurers control over their consumers: they better select markets and classes and retain insureds. The agent is an employee of the insurer, and the insurer own the rights to renewals. The insurer decides the marketing strategy and targets consumers. It can price higher without fear that agents will switch consumes to competitors; it can price lower to gain market share and retain the renewals.": 2,

Proponents of attachment parenting believe that these relationships are essential for children's emotional development and well-being.\\n\\nOne of the key concepts of attachment parenting is that of emotional regulation. Emotional regulation is the ability to manage one's emotions in a healthy way. Children who are securely attached to their parents are more likely to develop effective emotional regulation skills. This is because they learn to trust that their parents will be there to support them when they are feeling upset or stressed.\\n\\nSecurely attached children are also more likely to develop healthy self-esteem. Self-esteem is a person's overall sense of worth and value. Children who feel loved and accepted by their parents are more likely to develop positive self-esteem.\\n\\nAttachment parenting has been shown to have a positive impact on children's later social and emotional functioning. Studies have shown that securely attached children are more likely to have positive relationships with their peers, to be successful in school, and to be emotionally healthy adults.\\n\\nHere are some specific ways in which attachment parenting can help children develop emotional regulation and self-esteem:\\n\\n* **Responsiveness:** Responsive parenting is one of the most important factors in promoting emotional regulation and self-esteem in children.

Myelin helps to speed up the transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system and is crucial for proper brain function.\n\nOligodendrocytes can be divided into two main groups: the mature oligodendrocytes that form the insulating covers of neurons and the star-shaped precursor cells that give rise to the mature oligodendrocytes.\n\nDuring development, precursor cells divide into two main types: oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and neurons. OPCs then migrate to the brain and begin to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes.\n\nAs they differentiate, mature oligodendrocytes begin to wrap around the axon of a neuron, forming a myelin sheath. The more mature the oligodendrocyte, the thicker and compacter its myelin sheath becomes.\n\nThe process of oligodendrocyte differentiation is complex and involves a series of steps, including the production of specific proteins and the formation of specialized structures called nodes of Ranvier.\n\nOligodendrocytes are important for the proper functioning of the nervous system, and their loss or damage can lead to a range of neurological disorders, including Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and certain forms of dementia.\n\nSo, next time you're studying for a big test, don't for": 1,

  "Please reduce the following abstract to about 75% of its original length, without losing semantic meaning, and retaining the formal tone: \"Earth Reserve Assurance (ERA) is a new type of primary commodity reserve monetary framework. It is a decentralized multi-currency system with no central reference unit of account, in which each currency is anchored to relative changes observed in the independently verifiable long-term ecological capacity within its own currency zone to produce primary commodities. ERA was first generally described in 2009 by the present author to resolve complications and controversies of many previous commodity reserve and commodity benchmark monetary designs. During the past 15 years the operational details and enabling systems for ERA have been designed and developed, are now ready its incremental, experimental, participatory deployment, in transitional co-existence with incumbent systems, at a pace and scale determined by each central bank.\n\nMonetary designs grounded in economically significant commodities reach as far back as the period between 7,500 and 3,300 BCE when traders of the Fertile Crescent (between the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf) employed a standardized system of specially-shaped tokens representing units of particular categories of basic goods and services. Also, around 54 BCE China\u2019s Han Dynasty began operating of a \u201cconstantly normal granary\u201d which provided a central standard of worth for commerce. Later during the Sui Dynasty around 585 CE, a decentralized voluntary farmer-operated variant emerged with \u201cfree granaries\u201d. Under both the centrally mandated and voluntary cooperative models, when supply exceeded demand for any of the listed commodities, the granaries would buy those commodities at pre-published stable prices; and when demand exceeded supply, those granaries would sell the commodities at the pre-published stable prices. \n\nLeading up to the International Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in July 1944, NAME_1\u2019s proposed an standard monetary reference unit anchored to gold which he called the \u201cbancor\u201d (banco:bank, or:gold) operating similarly to the ancient granaries model. As is well-known, the outcome at Bretton Woods was that the United States dollar was assigned the role of global reference currency, anchored to gold at a price managed by the US Federal Reserve, while the central banks of all other countries benchmarked their national currencies to the US dollar.

Machine learning (ML) nowadays predominantly serves as the basis for NIDS decision making, where models are tuned to reduce false alarms, increase detection rates, and detect known and unknown attacks. At the same time, ML models have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that undermine the downstream task. In this work, we ask the practical question of whether real-world ML-based NIDS can be circumvented by crafted adversarial flows, and if so, how can they be created. We develop the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based attack algorithm NIDSGAN and evaluate its effectiveness against realistic ML-based NIDS. Two main challenges arise for generating adversarial network traffic flows: (1) the network features must obey the constraints of the domain (i.e., represent realistic network behavior), and (2) the adversary must learn the decision behavior of the target NIDS without knowing its model internals (e.g., architecture and meta-parameters) and training data. Despite these challenges, the NIDSGAN algorithm generates highly realistic adversarial traffic flows that evade ML-based NIDS. We evaluate our attack algorithm against two state-of-the-art DNN-based NIDS in whitebox, blackbox, and restricted-blackbox threat models and achieve success rates which are on average 99%, 85%, and 70%, respectively. We also show that our attack algorithm can evade NIDS based on classical ML models including logistic regression, SVM, decision trees and KNNs, with a success rate of 70% on average. Our results demonstrate that deploying ML-based NIDS without careful defensive strategies against adversarial flows may (and arguably likely will) lead to future compromises.\u2019\u2019\u2019": 0,

The straps were easy to ajst and tighten as needed.\n\nReview2: VERY safe helmet, easily scratches, heavier than expected\nMy 2 yo son (32\" tall, 23 lb) wears this. It's a great helmet for him - very snug, especially with the adjustable size as well as the extra padding they provide as well (you can change them out for the slightly thinner padding they placed in the helmet - it's attached via velcro). The chin strap adjusts easily. It's just slightly heavier than I like and scratches easily, but his head is nicely protected. Would purchase again, but maybe with more of a design on the helmet to hide scratches.\n\nReview 3: Enjoyed while it lasted.\nEasily adjustable. Thick pads. The outer shell seems pretty durable. Awesome matte look. Overall, we've been a fan of this helmet.\nUnfortunately, the inner foam separated from the outer shell (see photos). There was never any hard impact on the helmet or major damage to cause this to. happen.

This assumption can lead to errors in judgment and misinterpretations of data.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, NAME_2 presents an example of a financial advisor who meets with a new client and presents the results of his previous year's investments. The advisor explains that his portfolio outperformed the market, citing a sample size of only three investments. The advisor's conclusion is that his investment strategy is effective, but the small sample size makes it difficult to draw any reliable conclusions.\n\nNAME_2 also discusses how this bias can impact scientific research. Researchers may draw conclusions based on a small sample size, leading to inaccurate or incomplete results. This is particularly problematic in fields such as medicine or psychology, where small sample sizes can have significant consequences for treatment or diagnosis.\n\nTo counteract the effects of the Law of Small Numbers, NAME_2 recommends using statistical tools such as confidence intervals and effect sizes to determine the reliability of res": 2,
