  "Proofread the following internal audit finding. Here's the input text:\n\nInput Text: Several instances were noted of non-compliance with the SM policy's directive on payments (11.4), which states that \"pre-payment should be avoided\" and \"all purchases other than petty cash purchases should be on credit.\" Specifically, the institute entered into agreements with advance payment terms, including contracts with numerous contractors engaged to carry out various engineering projects on campus. For example, the Engineering Building Civil and Builders works project and the Refurbishment Of The Directorate Office project had contract values of KES 33,825,876.52 and KES 10,233,045, respectively. In both cases, KS Ltd, the contractor engaged to undertake the project, was paid 50% of the contract amount in advance. \n\nConsulting fees was been paid in advance in some cases, e.g. to CC Ltd, when hired to prepare a business plan and assist with the preparation of the Management Plan for K was paid 20% of the USD 33,000 contract amount in advance on 19th October 2022. Payment of consulting fees in advance is a contravention of section 13.1.3 of the SM Policy, which states, \"Consulting fees should be paid on the basis of deliverables. Advances are not advisable.\"\n\nIn most cases, including for the examples provided here, there was no evidence that the advance payments were either supported by a justification from the requesting units or a security, such as a performance bond, from the respective suppliers/consultants.\n\nYour task would be to generate an improved rewritten version of this finding that retains its tone and approach while avoiding overused phrases or repetition.
