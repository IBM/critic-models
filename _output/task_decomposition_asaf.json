He was a big football fan and had been looking forward to the Super Bowl for months. Finally, the day had come, and he was excited to go to the game with his family. When they entered the stadium, NAME_1 was amazed by the big crowds and bright lights. He couldn't believe he was really there, watching his favorite team play for the championship. The energy in the air was electric, and he could feel his heart racing with excitement. During the game, NAME_1 watched as the players ran down the field, making great catches and tackles. He cheered loudly, high-fiving other people and jumping in his seat.But what really caught NAME_1's attention was the way the players moved. They appeared to glide across the field effortlessly, as if they were being pushed forward by an invisible force. That's when he remembered something his science teacher had taught him: Newton's third law of motion. According to Newton's third law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In other words, when someone pushes or pulls on an object, the object pushes or pulls back with the same force. As NAME_1 watched the players run, jump, and tackle each other, he realized that they were constantly pushing and pulling on each other, following the principles of Newton's law. When one player ran forward, they pushed against the ground, which pushed back with an equal force, making them move forward. When two players collided, they pushed against each other, and the force was passed back and forth until one of them was knocked back.NAME_1 was fascinated by the way the players used their bodies to make force and move forward, and he couldn't believe how much science was involved in such an exciting game. As the game came to an end, NAME_1 felt a sense of wonder. He had seen one of the greatest sporting events of all time, and he had learned something new about the world around him. He couldn't wait to tell his friends and classmates about his experience, and to keep learning about the amazing world of science.": [

Make sure to have only one hazard per line. \n\"The Nutrient Database for Standard Reference published by the U.S.D.A. describes molluscan shellfish as an excellent source of vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, choline, iron, selenium, and zinc. Edible molluscs consist primarily of mussels, clams, scallops, and oysters and are naturally low in carbohydrate, as well as total and saturated fat. With regard to omega-3 fatty acids, iron, selenium, and zinc, the nutrient value of some shellfish is superior to land-based protein sources, such as beef, chicken, and pork. Unfortunately, adverse human health considerations need to be noted because of naturally occurring pathogens, particularly Vibrio species, and algal toxins (brevetoxin, saxitoxin, and domoic acid) that may be present in these shellfish, as well as fecal-associated viruses (hepatitis A and norovirus) and bacteria (Salmonella) as a consequence of contamination of shellfish harvest sites. Other environmental contaminants (mercury, methylmercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls) may bioaccumulate in molluscan shellfish tissues as part of their filter feeding behavior and have potential health implications. Cooking molluscan shellfish greatly reduces the risk of foodborne infections and increases the nutrient value because of water loss; however, some vitamins are destroyed by cooking and natural toxins and environmental contaminants are not always eliminated by normal cooking temperatures. Coastal monitoring of water quality and postharvest processing of some products should help mitigate risks associated with shellfish consumption and promote a safer, nutrient-rich product.\"": [
